      <h1>Location</h1>
      <p>
        Zwartewaalstraat is located in the south of Rotterdam (Charlois
        district), close to the city center, the Maas River, and the famous
        Erasmus Bridge. Rotterdam is known for its large international port and
        industrial district. Large companies such as Royal Dutch Shell occupy
        significant land mass close to civilian neighborhoods. National efforts
        have been made for many decades (since the 1960s) to monitor air quality
        in this region due to the exposure.
